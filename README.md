# Validation form

## This is a validation form from the knowledge that I got from **The Odin Project**

Created using **Constraint Validation Docs API**

### objective:

Build a browser form which collects Email, Country, Zip Code, Password and Password Confirmation fields. It should use live inline validation to inform the user whether a field is properly filled in or not. That means highlighting a field red and providing a helpful error message until it has been filled in properly.
